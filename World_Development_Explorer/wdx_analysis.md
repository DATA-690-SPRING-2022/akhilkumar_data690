## What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analysing (provide sufficient background information)?
In this report, I will examine the GDP per capita, Life Expectancy at Birth, and Suicide Mortality rates of different nations from 2010 to 2018, to see if the country's GDP has any impact on the population's Life Expectancy and Suicide Mortality rates. The countries I have chosen are  India, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, as well as Singapore, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and Germany
 
Gross domestic product(GDP) is the  total monetary or market worth of all finished goods and services produced inside a country's borders in a certain time period. The GDP per capita of a country is calculated by dividing its GDP by its population. Life expectancy  at birth is defined as how long they can expect to live on average if current death rates do not change. Suicide mortality rate is calculated by dividing the number of suicides each year by the total population.
 
## Why is it important to you and/or to others
Understanding a country's GDP is crucial since it reflect health of the economy. The country's mortality is determined by the life expectancy at birth and  suicide mortality rate . I chose these variables to examine if people with high GDP countries live longer than people in low GDP countries, and if a country's economic well-being  can contribute to people living longer.
 
## What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
The questions I have in my mind and want to analyze are 
- Which country has the most GDP among the selected countries, and which country has the lowest, and what is the Life Expectancy and Suicide Mortality of the countries?
- How have the countries' GDP, Life Expectancy, and Suicide Mortality Rates changed throughout time?
- Is there any relationship between a country's GDP and its population's Life Expectancy and Suicide Mortality rate over time?

## Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
To help us access this situation three indicators are considered from https://www.worlddev.xyz/ website.

## What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?	
I analyzed the problem using Bar chart, scatter plot and line chart.
